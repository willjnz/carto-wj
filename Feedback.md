In this documentation page:
https://docs.carto.com/carto-for-developers/carto-for-deck.gl/using-the-cartolayer
there is a link to this page which is broken. I needed it when reqearching the type prop:
https://docs.carto.com/deck-gl/reference#type-string

It was helpful coming here to see the types https://github.com/visgl/deck.gl/blob/8.9-release/modules/carto/src/layers/carto-layer.ts. I wish it was listed on th is page though https://docs.carto.com/carto-for-developers/carto-for-deck.gl/using-the-cartolayer
